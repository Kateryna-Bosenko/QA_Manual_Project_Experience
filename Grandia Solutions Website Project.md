### This project showcases thorough UI/UX and functional testing skills by identifying discrepancies between the live website and the Figma design mockups. The focus was on ensuring visual consistency, including layout, typography, colors, spacing, and interactive elements across various sections of the website. This included modals, forms, FAQs, reviews, resources, and navigation components.
### Activities included:
1. Comparing live site elements against Figma designs to detect mismatches in text placement, font sizes, line heights, and colors
2. Checking layout and spacing for sections such as review cards, step windows, and resources pages
3. Verifying correct display of text, buttons, and interactive elements according to design specifications
4. Documenting each bug with screenshots from the Figma design and the live site, along with environment details for reproducibility
### This project highlights attention to detail, a strong understanding of UI/UX standards, and the ability to systematically report issues to improve overall user experience.
