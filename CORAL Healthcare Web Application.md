### QA/UI Testing – Healthcare Web Application
* I conducted thorough QA testing on the Catalog, Plans, Home, and Patients pages across various devices and browsers, including iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.
* I verified the responsive layouts and the design accuracy against Figma mockups, as well as the core functionalities such as filters, the “Add to Plan” feature, patient search, and notifications.
* I logged and reported over 40 UI/UX bugs, which improved visual consistency, usability, and the overall user experience of the application.
